                    whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
                    accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica
                    production is located in the main coffee-growing
                    cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
                    produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily
                    grown in the northwestern much smaller state of
                    Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is
                    robusta.
